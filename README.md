# Implementation-of-Simple-Linear-Regression-Model-for-Predicting-the-Marks-Scored

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the marks scored by a student using the simple linear regression model.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1.Data Collection: Gather data on hours studied and marks scored.
2.Data Preprocessing: Split data into training and testing sets.
3.Model Training: Train a Simple Linear Regression model on training data.
4.Prediction: Use the trained model to predict marks on test data.
5.Evaluation & Visualization: Calculate error metrics and plot the regression line.
## Program:
